            <h1>Daniel Clifford<br>Verified Graduate</h1>
               <p> I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were current, if not more so, in the company I joined.
                 <br>I honestly feel I got every penny’s worth.<br> 
                 “ I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp.<br> 
                 I’ve been looking to make a transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here.<br> 
                 I signed up for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter.<br> 
                 The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing the course,<br>
                  I’ve successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ”</p></div>

                <h1>Jonathan Walters Verified Graduate</h1> The team was very supportive and kept me motivated “ I started as a total newbie with virtually no coding skills. I now work as a mobile engineer for a big company. This was one of the best investments I’ve made in myself. ”</div>

                    Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp themselves. Getting guidance from them and learning from their experiences was easy. “ The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which I find really refreshing. The program gave me the confidence necessary to be able to go out in the world and present myself as a capable junior developer. The standard is above the rest. You will get the personal attention you need from an incredible community of smart and amazing people. ”</div>
