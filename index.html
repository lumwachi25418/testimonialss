            <h1>Daniel Clifford<br>Verified Graduate</h1>
               <h2> I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were current, if not more so, in the company I joined.
                 <br>I honestly feel I got every penny’s worth.</h2> 
                <p>“ I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp.<br> 
                 I’ve been looking to make a transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here.<br> 
                 I signed up for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter.<br> 
                 The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing the course,<br>
                  I’ve successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ”</p></div>

                <h1>Jonathan Walters Verified Graduate</h1> The team was very supportive and kept me motivated “ I started as a total newbie with virtually no coding skills. I now work as a mobile engineer for a big company. This was one of the best investments I’ve made in myself. ”</div>
                <div class="grid-item3" ><img src="images/image-jeanette.jpg"> <h1>Jeanette Harmon Verified Graduate </h1>An overall wonderful and rewarding experience “ Thank you for the wonderful experience! I now have a job I really enjoy, and make a good living while doing something I love. ”

                    <div class="grid-item4" ><img src="images/image-patrick.jpg"><h1>Patrick Abrams Verified Graduate</h1> Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp themselves. Getting guidance from them and learning from their experiences was easy. “ The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which I find really refreshing. The program gave me the confidence necessary to be able to go out in the world and present myself as a capable junior developer. The standard is above the rest. You will get the personal attention you need from an incredible community of smart and amazing people. ” 
        
                   <div class="grid-item5"><img src="images/image-kira.jpg"><h1>Kira Whittle Verified Graduate </h1>Such a life-changing experience. Highly recommended! “ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve never written a line of code. I needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I’ve often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend! ”            </head>
